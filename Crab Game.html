        <h2>3D Platformer Game Test</h2>
        <p class='paragraph'> The purpose of this personal project is to use 3D models that I have created to make a 3D platformer 
            game on Unity and upload it to a website by exporting it as WebGl. To move the crab, first click on the game box to ensure
            you are within the game. Then use "spacebar" to jump and the "up","down","left","right" arrow keys to move back, forward, left,
            and right respectively. 
            <br><br>
            Continue reading to learn about the process that went into creating this piece.

				<h2>Research and Sketch the Crab</h2>
				<p class='paragraph'> After some research about the anatomical features of the fiddler crab (Minuca pugnax), reference 
                    photos were found and their morphology was examined via sketches. I tried to ensure that I got all angles of the crab 
                    as I will be using these images to help me model. 
                </p>

        <div>
            <h2>Rough Model the Crab</h2>
            <p class='paragraph'> Using Nomad Sculpt, I roughly modeled out the crabs from a sphere.

        <div>
            <h2>Refine Model</h2>
            <p class='paragraph'>Next I took the rough model from Nomad Sculpt, and combined the subtools. I then imported the obj model
                to ZBrush where I remeshed, UV wrapped, decimated, and projected details onto the model. The details I added included the hair on the frontal 
                carapace and legs, and the bumpy texture that can be found on the claws and top of the carapace. This photo shows the two crab models, 
                male and female, 3D printed.

        <div>
            <h2>Final Render of Crab Models</h2>
            <p class='paragraph'> After projecting details onto the crab, the models were polypainted to represent the colors typically found on
                these species. The models were then exported out of ZBrush and imported into Cinema 4D. In C4D, a physical environment was created 
                via displacement maps and textures downlowded from free sites such as polyhaven. Then using Octane scatter of built in 3D models of grass
                and the crab models I created an environment reminiscent of their nature environment, salt marshes. After placing some HDRi for lighting 
                and playing around with physical lights, a final render was created. 
                <br><br>
                Wanting to reuse this model for something interactive, I decided to create an environment for a game.

        <h2>Model the Bedroom</h2>
        <p class='paragraph'> In Blender, I created the bedroom. 
        </p>
</div> <div><img src="Bedroom.png" alt="bedroom model"  ></div>
<div>
    <h2>Render the Bedroom</h2>
    <p class='paragraph'> In Blender, I added lights to mimic moonlight coming from the window and light emitting from the 
        lamp. Then rendered it out using playblast. Please note the figure head in the bed was created by a classmate as we used 
        this bedroom environment for another project (<a href='https://vesaliustrust.org/upcoming-events/trustathon-2022/6-cess/' class="accentColor bold">Floresta</a>- an interactive game educating users on the benefits of sleep created 
        as a team for the Versalius Trust-a-Thon). 
    </p>
</div> <div><img src="Start_Page7.png" alt="bedroom model rendered"  ></div>
<div>
    <h2>Put it All Together in Unity</h2>
    <p class='paragraph'> I imported the crab and bedroom objects into Unity. Then added many components such as rigidbody, collider, 
        and a C# script to allow the crab object to move when keys are pressed. This game file was then exported as WebGl and placed
        in GitHub so it can be hosted on a webpage for all the access. As I continue to work on this project, I will look into how to 
        import textures for the objects, and how to create a start page for the game that allows the player to reset. It would also be 
        and added bonus if there was a way to control the camera angle as a user of this game.
